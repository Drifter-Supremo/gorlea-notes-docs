## Recent Changes

- **(April 13, 2025)** Fixed Mobile Keyboard Overlap (`client-vite/chat.html`):
    - **Problem:** On mobile devices, the virtual keyboard obscured the chat input and recent messages. Previous CSS attempts (e.g., `100vh` adjustments) were unreliable.
    - **Solution:** Implemented JavaScript using the `visualViewport` API in `client-vite/src/chat.js`. This API accurately detects the visible area excluding the keyboard.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Added event listeners (`resize`, `scroll`) for `visualViewport`.
        - Dynamically calculated the available height and adjusted the `bottom` style of the fixed footer (`#chat-footer`) and the `padding-bottom` of the chat messages container (`#messages`) to ensure the input stays visible and the chat area resizes correctly when the keyboard appears/disappears.
        - Reverted previous CSS-only attempts in `client-vite/src/styles/main.css`.
        - Modified `client-vite/vite.config.js` temporarily for HTTPS local testing required by `visualViewport` on some mobile browsers/setups.
    - **Outcome:** The chat input and messages now correctly adjust on mobile when the keyboard is shown or hidden, resolving the overlap issue.
    - **Files Modified:** `client-vite/src/chat.js`, `client-vite/src/styles/main.css`, `client-vite/vite.config.js` (for testing).


- **(April 13, 2025)** Implemented Mobile Responsiveness for Chat UI (`client-vite/chat.html`):
    - **Goal:** Create a functional and visually appealing mobile layout for the chat interface.
    - **Implementation:**
        - Added CSS media queries (`@media (max-width: 768px)`) in `client-vite/src/styles/main.css`.
        - Modified `client-vite/chat.html` structure for mobile header (logo left, hamburger right, fixed 60px height).
        - Implemented hamburger button toggle logic in `client-vite/src/chat.js`.
        - Created a side navigation panel (`#side-nav`) that slides in from the right.
    - **Process:** Involved iterative CSS adjustments to fix layout issues (e.g., header alignment, panel positioning/transition) and JS fixes for toggle functionality. Overcame an accidental file overwrite by reverting and reapplying changes carefully.
    - **Files Modified:** `client-vite/chat.html`, `client-vite/src/styles/main.css`, `client-vite/src/chat.js`.

- **(April 11, 2025)** Attempted mobile responsiveness overhaul:
    - Added mobile-specific CSS overrides using `@media (max-width: 768px)` to `main.css` and `docs.css`.
    - Attempted a mobile-first CSS restructuring, which inadvertently broke desktop layout.
    - **Decision:** Rolled back changes to commit `fb8588a` ("mobile layout fix") via `git reset --hard`.
    - **Outcome:** Project reverted to previous state. Mobile responsiveness remains basic; focus shifted back to desktop MVP functionality for now.
- **(April 11, 2025)** Fixed Tiptap editor spacing and added paste sanitization:
    - Adjusted CSS in `docs.css` for consistent line-height and margins.
    - Added `transformPastedHTML` to Tiptap config in `editor.js` to clean pasted HTML.
    - Fixed related syntax error in `editor.js`.
- **(April 11, 2025)** Fixed frontend document creation error:
    - Resolved `ReferenceError: newDocButton is not defined` in `client-vite/src/docs/docList.js`.
    - Moved DOM element definitions (`newDocButton`, `docList`, `noDocsMessage`) to top-level scope.
    - Document creation flow now works correctly for new users.
- **(April 11, 2025)** Added new Documentation mode:
    - Created `UpdaterBot` mode in `.roomodes` for managing memory bank updates.
    - Configured with specific responsibilities, rules, and file access restrictions (`/memory-bank/*.md`).

- **(April 10, 2025)** Railway Deployment & Debugging:
    - Created Railway project linked to GitHub (`master` branch).
    - Configured Build Command: `npm install && cd server && npm install && cd ../client-vite && npm install && npm run build`
    - Configured Start Command: `node server/index.js`
    - Added required environment variables (Firebase Admin, Gemini, Session Secret, NODE_ENV=production).
    - **Troubleshooting:**
        - Fixed initial Nixpacks build failure by adding `.node-version` file (specifying Node 20).
        - Fixed `npm: command not found` by ensuring `.node-version` was on the correct branch (`master`).
        - Fixed `Cannot find module 'dotenv'` error by ensuring server dependencies were installed via `cd server && npm install` in the build command.
        - Fixed `Cannot GET /login.html` (and other pages) by:
            - Initially removing `app.get('*', ...)` catch-all in `server/index.js`.
            - Investigating build output (Vite *was* building HTML files to `server/public`).
            - Adding explicit `app.get()` routes for each HTML page in `server/index.js`.
            - Confirming `vite.config.js` correctly used `resolve` for `outDir`.
            - Adding `login.html` and `register.html` to Vite build inputs (`vite.config.js`).
        - Fixed `401 Unauthorized` after login (session not persisting) by:
            - Confirming `credentials: 'include'` was present in frontend `fetch` calls (`auth.js`).
            - Adding `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` to `server/index.js`.
            - Explicitly setting `cookie.sameSite = 'Lax'` in `expressSession` config (`server/index.js`).
    - **Result:** Successful deployment with working login and navigation. URL: `https://gorlea-notes-docs-production.up.railway.app/` (Verify this URL).
- **(April 10, 2025)** Page Load Transition & Logo Flash Fix:
    - Implemented CSS fade-in transition (`opacity: 0` to `opacity: 1`) for main page containers (`.app`, `.docs-app`, etc.) triggered by adding a `.loaded` class via JavaScript on `DOMContentLoaded`.
    - Added inline `width` and `height` styles to logo `<img>` tags in HTML files (`chat.html`, `index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`, `docs/index.html`) to prevent flash/layout shift before CSS loads.
- **(April 10, 2025)** Favicon Implementation:
    - Added Gorlea logo (`/gorlea-logo.png`) as favicon to main HTML pages (`chat.html`, `docs/index.html`, `docs/editor.html`, `index.html`). Login/Register pages already had it.
- **(April 10, 2025)** Docs List "No Documents" Message:
    - Refactored `client-vite/docs/index.html` to separate list container (`#doc-list`) and message container (`#no-docs-message`).
    - Updated `client-vite/src/docs/docList.js` (`init` function) to correctly show/hide the list or the message based on fetched document count. Simplified error handling. Moved DOM selections into `init`.
- **(April 10, 2025)** Git Reset:
    - Rolled back changes using `git reset --hard HEAD` to commit `b847c74` after previous attempts to fix docs list UI caused broader issues.

### Update: April 5, 2025 - Chat Scroll Debugging & Fixes

- **Issue:** Gorlea's confirmation messages were sometimes cut off or not auto-scrolling.
- **Root Causes:**
  - Removed padding/margin from Gorlea messages.
  - Async message timing (API confirmations added after initial AI response).
  - Overly complex scroll logic relying on `.last-message` and animation frames.
- **Debugging Process:**
  - Inspected CSS and container layout.
  - Tested scroll timing with various methods.
  - Identified async timing as a key factor.
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Added **extra bottom padding** to `.chat-container`.
  - Added **margin-bottom** to `.gorlea-message`.
  - Reverted to **simple container scroll** (`scrollTop = scrollHeight`) for reliability.
- **Current Status:** Chat now **auto-scrolls smoothly** for all messages, including async confirmations.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Async UI updates require scroll logic that accounts for timing and layout.
  - Sufficient padding/margin is critical for reliable scrolling.
  - Simpler scroll methods can be more robust.
- **Next:** Continue refining chat UX, test edge cases, and document these patterns.
