## In Progress
🔨 Gorlea Docs Feature Enhancements
- [✓] Auto-save implementation (Completed, UI removed)
- [✓] Delete button and functionality (Now includes Archive)
- [✓] Rich text editor integration (Tiptap) (Basic integration complete)
- [ ] Gorlea Notes integration planning
- [ ] Export functionality (lower priority)
- [ ] Error handling improvements

---

## Recent Fixes (April 8, 2025)
- Fixed AI processing error by updating `requireAuth` middleware in `server/routes/ai.js` to check `req.session.user` instead of obsolete `req.session.tokens`.
- Implemented **user-specific chat history** in `client-vite/src/chat.js`:
  - Chat history is now saved and loaded per user account using a key like `gorleaChatHistory_USERID`.
  - Switching accounts resets the chat to default, preventing cross-user chat history leakage.
- Added `"create a doc called"` to explicit create command patterns in `client-vite/src/chat.js` to fix misinterpretation of that phrase as a note.

---

## Next Task (Planned)
- **Enhance Gorlea Docs List Page (`client-vite/docs/index.html` and `client-vite/src/docs/docList.js`):**
  - When no documents exist, display a friendly message like **"No documents found. Click 'New Document' to create your first one!"** instead of a blank page.
  - Add error handling for failed document fetches, displaying a message like **"Error loading documents. Please try again later."**
  - Style these messages clearly so users understand the state.
- **(Task Completed)**

## Next Task: Production Testing (Railway)
1.  **Test Register Flow:** Ensure new account creation works and logs in.
2.  **Test Logout/Login:** Confirm sessions clear and restore correctly.
3.  **Test Doc Editing/Saving:** Verify edits persist after reload.
4.  **Test New Doc Creation:** Ensure it appears in list and opens.
5.  **Test Editor Direct Link:** Check if `/docs/editor.html?id=XYZ` loads correctly.
6.  **Add Debugging Failsafe:** Add basic console logs to auth/session endpoints for future debugging.

### Update: April 5, 2025 - Chat Scroll Bug Fixed

- **Issue:** Gorlea's confirmation messages were sometimes cut off or not auto-scrolling.
- **Fixes Applied:**
  - Added **extra bottom padding** to `.chat-container`.
  - Added **margin-bottom** to `.gorlea-message`.
  - Reverted to **simple container scroll** (`scrollTop = scrollHeight`).
- **Result:** Chat now **auto-scrolls smoothly** for all messages, including async confirmations.
- **Lessons Learned:**
  - Async UI updates require scroll logic that accounts for timing and layout.
  - Sufficient padding/margin is critical for reliable scrolling.
  - Simpler scroll methods can be more robust.
- **Status:** Issue resolved and documented in Memory Bank.

---

**Summary of Session (4/6):**
*   **Goal:** Refactor frontend and backend to remove hardcoded API base URLs and simplify environment variable handling for deployment.
*   **Frontend:**
    *   Removed `apiBaseUrl` definitions from `client-vite/src/auth.js`, `client-vite/src/chat.js`, `client-vite/src/docs/docList.js`, and `client-vite/src/docs/editor.js`.
    *   Updated all `fetch` calls in these files to use relative paths (e.g., `/api/docs`).
*   **Backend:**
    *   Corrected Firebase Admin initialization in `server/utils/firestore.js` to automatically use the standard `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable (which contains the file path), simplifying the logic.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   Created a local `.env` file with `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` pointing to the local key file path (using forward slashes).
    *   Confirmed `.gitignore` correctly ignores `.env`.
    *   Identified that `client-vite/netlify.toml` was missing and provided the necessary content for Netlify proxy configuration.
