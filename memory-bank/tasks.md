## Testing Checklist

1.  **Register Flow:**
    *   Go to the `/register.html` page.
    *   Create a brand new user account.
    *   Verify that registration is successful and redirects to the login page.
    *   Log in with the newly created account.
    *   Verify that login is successful and redirects to `/chat.html`.

2.  **Logout / Login Flow:**
    *   While logged in, click the "Logout" button.
    *   Verify you are redirected to `/login.html`.
    *   Log back in with the same account.
    *   Verify login is successful and redirects to `/chat.html`.
    *   Close the browser tab/window completely.
    *   Reopen the browser and navigate back to the application URL.
    *   Verify you are still logged in (e.g., you see `/chat.html` or your email in the header, not the login page).

3.  **Document Editing & Saving:**
    *   Log in with an account that has existing documents (e.g., Account 1).
    *   Navigate to Gorlea Docs (`/docs` or `/docs/index.html`).
    *   Open an existing document.
    *   Make a noticeable edit to the content or title.
    *   Wait a few seconds for autosave (or navigate away via "Docs Home").
    *   Reload the page or navigate back to the document list and reopen the same document.
    *   Verify that your edits were saved correctly.

4.  **New Document Creation:**
    *   While logged in, navigate to Gorlea Docs.
    *   Click the "New Document" button.
    *   Verify you are taken to the editor page for a new document (likely with "Untitled Document" as the title).
    *   Add a title and some content.
    *   Navigate back to the "Docs Home" (document list).
    *   Verify the new document appears in the list.
    *   Click the new document in the list.
    *   Verify it opens correctly in the editor with the title and content you added.

5.  **Editor Direct Link:**
    *   Find the ID of an existing document (you might need to look in Firestore or add it to the UI temporarily if not visible).
    *   Construct the URL: `https://gorlea-notes-docs-production.up.railway.app/docs/editor.html?id=DOCUMENT_ID` (replace `DOCUMENT_ID` with the actual ID).
    *   Log in to the application in one tab.
    *   Open a *new* browser tab and paste the constructed URL.
    *   Verify that the editor loads directly with the correct document content.

6.  **(Optional but Recommended) Add Debugging Failsafe:**
    *   Add basic `console.log` statements to key backend endpoints involved in authentication and session handling (e.g., in `authController.js` for login/logout/register, and in `userController.js` for `/api/user/me`, and potentially in the `requireAuth` middleware). Log things like `req.session.user` or success/failure points.
    *   This is a code change for *after* the initial testing, to aid future debugging if needed.
