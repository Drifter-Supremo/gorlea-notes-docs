## Testing Status (April 11, 2025)

**Summary:** Initial production testing is largely successful. Login/logout, session persistence, document listing/creation/editing/saving, and **AI features (rewrite, save suggestions)** are confirmed working. The "No documents" message displays correctly. A bug preventing new document creation for new users was identified (frontend ReferenceError) and fixed. Tiptap editor spacing and paste sanitization are also working correctly.

**Remaining Tests:**
- Editor Direct Link (#5)
- (Optional) Add Debugging Failsafe (#6)

## Testing Checklist (Updated April 11, 2025)

1.  **[✓ - Partially Tested] Register Flow:**
    *   [✓] Go to the `/register.html` page.
    *   [✓] Create a brand new user account. (Password mismatch check worked).
    *   [✓] Verify that registration is successful and redirects to the login page.
    *   [✓] Log in with the newly created account.
    *   [✓] Verify that login is successful and redirects to `/chat.html`.
    *   *Note: Initial test failed at document creation step, but this was due to a separate frontend bug that is now fixed.*

2.  **[✓ - Completed] Logout / Login Flow:**
    *   [✓] While logged in, click the "Logout" button.
    *   [✓] Verify you are redirected to `/login.html`.
    *   [✓] Log back in with the same account.
    *   [✓] Verify login is successful and redirects to `/chat.html`.
    *   [✓] Close the browser tab/window completely.
    *   [✓] Reopen the browser and navigate back to the application URL.
    *   [✓] Verify you are still logged in (e.g., you see `/chat.html` or your email in the header, not the login page).
    *   *User confirmed this works correctly across multiple accounts.*

3.  **[✓ - Completed] Document Editing & Saving:**
    *   [✓] Log in with an account that has existing documents (e.g., Account 1).
    *   [✓] Navigate to Gorlea Docs (`/docs` or `/docs/index.html`). (Correct docs show per user).
    *   [✓] Open an existing document. (Opens fine).
    *   [✓] Make a noticeable edit to the content or title.
    *   [✓] Wait a few seconds for autosave (or navigate away via "Docs Home"). (Autosave works).
    *   [✓] Reload the page or navigate back to the document list and reopen the same document.
    *   [✓] Verify that your edits were saved correctly.
    *   *User confirmed this works correctly.*

4.  **[✓ - Completed (Post-Fix)] New Document Creation:**
    *   [✓] While logged in, navigate to Gorlea Docs. ("No documents" message shows correctly for new accounts).
    *   [✓] Click the "New Document" button. (*Initial test failed here due to frontend bug*).
    *   [✓] Verify you are taken to the editor page for a new document (likely with "Untitled Document" as the title). (*Now works after frontend fix*).
    *   [✓] Add a title and some content.
    *   [✓] Navigate back to the "Docs Home" (document list).
    *   [✓] Verify the new document appears in the list.
    *   [✓] Click the new document in the list.
    *   [✓] Verify it opens correctly in the editor with the title and content you added.
    *   *User confirmed this works correctly after the frontend fix for `newDocButton` ReferenceError.*

5.  **[ ] Editor Direct Link:**
    *   Find the ID of an existing document (you might need to look in Firestore or add it to the UI temporarily if not visible).
    *   Construct the URL: `https://gorlea-notes-docs-production.up.railway.app/docs/editor.html?id=DOCUMENT_ID` (replace `DOCUMENT_ID` with the actual ID).
    *   Log in to the application in one tab.
    *   Open a *new* browser tab and paste the constructed URL.
    *   Verify that the editor loads directly with the correct document content.
    *   *Status: Not yet tested.*

6.  **[ ] (Optional but Recommended) Add Debugging Failsafe:**
    *   Add basic `console.log` statements to key backend endpoints involved in authentication and session handling (e.g., in `authController.js` for login/logout/register, and in `userController.js` for `/api/user/me`, and potentially in the `requireAuth` middleware). Log things like `req.session.user` or success/failure points.
    *   This is a code change for *after* the initial testing, to aid future debugging if needed.
    *   *Status: Not yet implemented.*

7.  **[✓ - Completed] Gorlea Notes AI Features:**
    *   [✓] Log in and navigate to the chat interface (`/chat.html`).
    *   [✓] Enter a messy note and send it.
    *   [✓] Verify the AI rewrites the note clearly.
    *   [✓] Verify the AI prompts to save the note (suggesting existing docs or new).
    *   [✓] Test saving the note to a new document. Verify it appears in the Docs list.
    *   [✓] Test saving the note by appending it to an existing document. Verify the content is appended correctly in the editor.
    *   *User confirmed AI rewrite and save suggestions are working correctly.*
